Context for curious programmers:

In the Rust programming language, Cargo.toml is the manifest file for Rust's package manager, Cargo. This file contains metadata such as the project name, version, and dependencies (called "crates" in Rust). It's essentially a configuration file that defines how Cargo should build and manage your Rust project.
